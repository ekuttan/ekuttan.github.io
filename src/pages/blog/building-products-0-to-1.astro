            The journey of building a product from scratch is never linear. After years of shipping MVPs and watching some succeed while others failed, I've come to appreciate the chaos that comes with the 0 to 1 phase.

            The myth of the perfect idea
          </h2>
          <p>
            Most first-time builders wait for the perfect idea. They want something unique, something nobody has ever thought of. But here's the truth: the idea is the easy part. Execution is everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Chillr, we didn't invent P2P payments. We just made it work for Indians in a way that felt natural. The magic wasn't in the concept—it was in understanding the user deeply enough to remove every friction point.
          </p>

            Start with the problem, not the solution
          </h2>
          <p>
            I've seen countless founders fall in love with their solution before validating the problem. They build elaborate features that nobody asked for. The best products I've worked on started with a simple question: "What's the smallest thing we can build that solves a real pain point?"
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn't about building an MVP for the sake of it. It's about learning faster than your competition. Every day you spend building without user feedback is a day you might be running in the wrong direction.
          </p>

            The uncomfortable truth about shipping
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late. This is cliché advice, but it's cliché because it's true. The first version of anything I've built has been rough around the edges.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key is knowing which edges to smooth and which to leave rough. Core functionality must work flawlessly. Everything else can wait. Users will forgive ugly UI. They won't forgive broken promises.
          </p>

            From 1 to infinity
          </h2>
          <p>
            Getting from 0 to 1 is about finding product-market fit. Getting from 1 to infinity is a different game entirely—it's about scale, systems, and letting go. But that's a story for another post.
          </p>
          <p>
            For now, if you're building something new, remember: start small, ship fast, and listen harder than you talk. The market will tell you what it wants. Your job is to be paying attention.
