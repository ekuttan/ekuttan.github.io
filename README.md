# ekuttan.in

The digital home of a college dropout who accidentally became good at building things.

## What's This?

A portfolio site for Abid Aboobaker — a tinkerer, coder, and professional "0 → 1 → ∞" enthusiast. Built with more care than my college attendance record.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install    # Summon the dependencies
npm run dev    # Spin up localhost:4321
npm run build  # Ship it
```

## Tech Stack

- **Astro 5** — because React was too mainstream
- **Tailwind CSS** — for people who think CSS is a team sport
- **TypeScript** — strict mode, because I don't trust myself

## Deployment

Pushes to `master` → Cloudflare Pages → [ekuttan.in](https://ekuttan.in)

No CI/CD drama. Just vibes.

## License

Do whatever you want with it. But if you copy my bio, at least drop out of a different degree.
