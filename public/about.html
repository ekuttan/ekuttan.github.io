      <div class="text-2xl">Our Initiative</div>
      <p class="py-4">Amber Health is a volunteer run non-profit initiative based out of Bangalore. It was started by medical professionals and technology experts who have created a digital platform for COVID-19 plasma donation facilitation. </p>
      <p class="p-4 bg-secondary text-white">Our main aim is to help increase plasma availability at blood banks and COVID-19 treatment centres even before a recipient request reaches them.</p>
      <p class="px-8 py-4">We at Amber Health are focusing on helping voluntary plasma donors get connected with:</p>
        <p class="px-8">* Licensed plasma donor centres for a safe and smooth plasma donation experience</p>
        <p class="px-8">AND</p>
        <p class="px-8">* Recipient requests through verified channels as and when required</p>
      
      <div class="text-2xl pt-16">Our Story</div>
        <p class="py-4">We are a couple who have personally faced the difficulties of  COVID-19, hence understand the panic and helplessness of arranging a donor at desperate times. While suffering from the disease ourselves, we were searching for plasma donors for our father who was undergoing treatment and in a critical condition.</p><p class="py-4">The timely  availability of a donor helped our father recover and saw our family through a time of crisis. There were very few means of finding donors back then and our main tools were social media and a wide network of family and friends. Driven by our experience, we started on a journey to make a difference by first becoming donors ourselves and then creating Amber Health to help others in need.</p>
        <p class="my-16 bg-secondary"><span class="px-4 bg-secondary text-white"> Please share this website in your circles. Even if youâ€™re not a donor, you will help a life by bringing this information to somebody who could be a potential donor.</span> </p>
