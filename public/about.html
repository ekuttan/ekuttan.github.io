      <p class="py-4">Amber Health is a volunteer non-profit initiative run by medical professionals and technology experts working in Bangalore who believe the best way to tackle COVID-19 is by being prepared with ample resources to fight it timely. We have come together to help in increasing plasma reserves in blood banks across India by encouraging COVID-19 survivors to donate plasma. We at Amber Health are doing our bit by helping voluntary donors get connected with blood banks for plasma donation or directly to recipients in need of plasma.</p>

      <div class="text-2xl">Our Story</div>

      <p class="py-4">We are a husband and wife couple who recovered from COVID-19 in May 2020. We were able to overcome a time of crisis in our family when a generous person donated plasma for our father who was fighting for his life due to COVID-19. We sincerely understand the sense of panic and helplessness and wish to help others overcome it.</p> 
      We started on our journey by first becoming donors ourselves and then creating Amber Health with help of our friends and colleagues! We are happy to share our personal experience in how we dealt with COVID-19. *click here*</p>
